> This application is a demonstration of how to use Spring to authenticate through the OAuth2 protocol.

#### What's the easiest way to run this application locally?
Basically, you are just going to run the shell file:

```bash
chmod +x runApp.sh
./runApp.sh
```

#### What will you need?
1. Create an OAuth2 app on github as per the [Github OAuth2 Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).
2. Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) installed on your machine.
3. Manage Docker as a non-root user. [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
